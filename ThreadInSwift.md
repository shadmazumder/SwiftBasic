Difference between `concurrent` & `parallelism`

`concurrent` & `serial` both work on background thread.

# `concurrent`:
Parallel execution. Multiple booth of food corner, serving multiple people at a time of multiple lines of people. The current server person does not know if he is the only one or not to get served.

# `serial`:
One at a time. Single booth of food corner, serving one at a time of a single line of people. The current served person knows he is the only one to get served.

# `synchronous`:
The current served person wait for the food and do not leave the counter until he gets his food after ordering.

# `asynchronous`:
The current served person does not wait for the food, he leaves as soon as he order the food.
